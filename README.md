## Main Goals of the Project

Our purpose of analyzing this data set is to detect trends and patterns of the NBA over the last 20 years. We want to understand how teams and players have changed over time and how that may impact future seasons. We will use the data from espn.com and use web scraping to obtain the necessary data. Then, we will organize the data in order to derive different types of analysis. We expect to manipulate data frames and create visualizations to support analyses and trends.
